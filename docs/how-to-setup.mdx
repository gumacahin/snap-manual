## Establish Seedlings

### Required Materials

#### Sowing Tray

Shallow box or basin with holes for drainage at the bottom. This can be fashioned
out of microwavable containers. Be sure to add drainage holes at the bottom. It
is important that water is allowed to drain off the container, otherwise seeds or
seedlings will sit in water which can cause the seeds to rot and the seedlings
to drown.

It’s best to keep the lid since it can be used to keep the moisture in and help
with the seed germination. If the lid is to be used in such a manner, add aeration
holes on them to allow some air to escape and circulate.

#### Growing Media

There are a number of materials that can be used as growing media for seed
raising. Cocopeat is used as growing media in this manual.

Regular potting mixes also work, specially the ones designed for seed raising.
The use of soil that is dug up from the surroundings is not recommended because
it could be contaminated with pests and pathogens.

/>

#### Seeds

Seed packets can be bought from local garden centers or agri-vet centers. Hardware
stores in malls also have these in their gardening section. Bookstores and
grocery stores occassionally stock seed packets as well.

For beginners, it is strongly recommended to start with leafy vegetables such as
lettuce, pechay, mustasa or kangkong.

### Procedure

1. Fill the sowing tray with a layer of moist cocopeat around 2.5cm thick (one
inch).

2. Pack and level the cocopeat.

3. Spread the seeds uniformly and thinly over the cocopeat. For reference, a
pinch of small seeds (lettuce seeds for example) contains around 20-50 seeds.
Be sure to consider the germination rate of the seeds which is usually indicated
in the seed packets.

    alt="Close up of a seed packet label showing details such as purity,
      germination rate, moisture content, net weight and sow by date."
    src="seed-packet-label.jpg"
  />

4. Water liberally. How long the seed will take to germinate is usually indicated
on the sowing instructions printed on the seed packet. There are a number of
factors that can affect how long the seeds will take to germinate and the
germination rate. Depending on the freshness of the seeds, first signs of
germination usually appear within the next 24-72 hours with most of the seeds
germinating one to two weeks.

5. Grow the seedlings for 10-14 days before transferring to individual seedling
plugs.

## Prepare Grow Boxes

### Required Materials

#### Styrobox

Boxes made of expanded polystyrene (EPS) known commonly as “styrofoam box” or
simply “styrobox” make excellent materials for grow box (or growing box). The
size recommended for use with SNAP Hydroponics is 20"×16"×6". These boxes can
hold 10-12 liters of nutrient solution and has enough room to grow up to eight
leafy vegetables and up to five fruiting vegetables. Styroboxes of this size are
used to transport US imported grapes and are typically common during the months
of September to February.

#### Lining Material

Styrofoam boxes has ventilation holes running along the edges. In order for the
bottom half of the box to hold the nutrient solution it must be lined with a
sturdy waterproofing sheet. This manual uses 20"✕30" polyethylene (PE) plastic
bags.

<Figure
  caption="A typical brand of 20✕30 inch PE plastic bags."
  alt="White bag with a label indicating its contents."
  src="pe-plastic-bag-20-by-30.jpg"
/>

#### Styrofoam Puncher

A [styrofoam puncher](/docs/guides/styrofoam-puncher) is required to make holes
on the upper half of the grow box for the seedling plugs. A tin can of the
appropriate diameter for the seedling plug can be fashioned into such a tool.

#### Packaging Tape

This will be used to hold the lining material in place and optionally cover the
ventilation holes.

#### Bamboo Stick

A bamboo stick or similar implement is used to draw guidelines on the styrofoam.
It is also used to safely remove the styrofoam piece from the styrofoam puncher
after each cut.

### Procedure

1. Flip the upperhalf of the styrobox over and place it on a flat surface. Put
a piece of plywood or cardboard in between the surface and the styrofoam to
prevent the surface from being damaged by the styrofoam puncher during the
cutting step of the procedure.

2. Draw guide lines connecting the ventilation holes from opposite sides of the
box as illustrated below. A hole should be made centered where the lines cross.

  <Figure
    caption="Lines connecting ventilation holes in opposite sides. A hole is
      made where they intersect."
    alt="Upper half of the grow box showing how the guidelines are drawn."
    src="guide-lines.jpg"
  />

3. To make holes, put the sharp end of the styrofoam puncher on the styrofoam
and apply pressure to score the surface. Hold the tool by the handles and apply
pressure while moving the tool in a clockwise and counter-clockwise direction
making tool cut deeper through the foam. Continue this process until the tool
cuts through the foam.

4. Pull out the styrofoam puncher carefully. A circular piece of foam will be
left on one end of the tool. Use the stick to safely push one side of the piece
into the tool. This will cause piece to rotate and the other side will be pushed
out of the tool allowing it to be safely extracted.

5. Repeat this process to create the rest of the holes.

  <Figure caption="Holes are punched where the guide lines intersect."
    alt="Upper half of the grow box showing how the punched holes are positioned
      with respect to the guide lines."
    src="grow-box-top-bottom-view.jpg"
  />

6. It is strongly recommended to use packing tape to cover the ventilation holes
on this half of the styrobox if the growing area does not have protection from
mosquitoes. This will deny mosquitoes access to the nutrient solution and stop
them from breeding in the grow box.

7. Line the lower half of the styrobox with the PE plastic bag.

## Prepare Seedling Plugs

### Required Materials

#### Styrofoam Cups

This guide uses eight-ounce styrofoam cups pictured below.

<Figure
  caption="Typical 8oz styrofoam cup."
  alt="Styro cups: upside down and rightside up."
  src="styro-cup.jpg"
/>

#### Small Hand Saw or Similar

This is used to cut slits at the bottom of the styro cups.

#### Established Seedlings

Please [see section on establishing seedlings](#establish-seedlings).

#### Growing Media

There are a number of materials that can be used as growing media. This manual
uses cocopeat.

#### BBQ Stick or Similar Implements

This is used to uproot seedlings from the sowing tray. This is also used as
digging implement when transferring the seedlings to the seedling plugs.

### Procedure

1. Using a handsaw, make four to six vertical slits on the side of the cup
starting from the bottom. It should run two-thirds along the side of the cup and
about one-third the radius of the bottom of the cup.

  <Figure
    caption="Bottom of seedling plug with slits running along the side and
      bottom."
    alt="Bottom of seedling plug showing slits running along the side and bottom."
    src="seedling-plug-bottom.jpg"
  />

2. Add coco peat to the prepared styro cups. One-fourth to one-third the volume
of the cup is sufficient—just enough to support the seedling upright. The lesser
the better because the less growing media there is in the cup the faster it is
for the roots to find its way to the nutrient solution.

3. Transplant the seedlings from the sowing tray to the cups. Use a stick or a
similar implement to uproot the seedlings from the sowing tray with care. “Dig”
a hole in the middle of the growing media in the cup using a stick or similar
implement. Transfer only one seedling per cup. Make the transferred seedling
stand firmly by moving the growing media around the base of the seedling using
a stick.

4. If desired, the seedlings in the seedling plugs can be _hardened off_ before
they are transferred to the grow boxes. Let the prepared seedling plug sit in a
shallow pool of diluted working solution for a few days.

## Setting Up the SNAP Hydroponics System

### Materials Needed

#### SNAP Nutrient Solution for Hydroponics

The SNAP Hydroponics system requires the use of SNAP Nutrient Solution for
Hydroponics. They are developed and manufactured in IPB-UPLB. They are sold at
the National Seed Foundation and also distributed by SNAP Authorized Resellers.

#### Seedling Plugs

Please [see section on seedling plugs.](#prepare-seedling-plugs)

#### Grow Boxes

Please [see section on grow boxes.](#prepare-grow-boxes)

#### Clean Water

Deep well and regular tap water works well. SNAP is designed for use with water
from typical water sources in the Philippines. Using water that has gone through
reverse osmosis (distilled water) doesn’t fit SNAP’s working parameters and the
resulting nutrient mixture will not be suitable for hydroponics growing.

#### Benches

Optional benches or stand where the grow boxes will be placed under a shelter.

#### Shelter

Greenhouse, rain shelter or roof awning facing east for the earliest and longest
sunlight exposure possible.

### Procedure

1. Arrange the grow boxes in the shelter. Make sure that each one is leveled and
each one is receiving sufficient sunlight to support the plants’ growth.

2. Fill each grow box with 10L of water.

  <Figure
    caption="Adding 10L of clean water to the bottom half of the grow box."
    alt="Water being poured on the bottom half of a grow box."
    src="adding-water.jpg"
  />

3. Add 25 mL of SNAP A. Mix well. Add 25 ml of SNAP B. Mix well. Either SNAP A
or SNAP B can be added to the water first but **remember to stir the mixture
 thoroughly** in between adding the SNAP A/B nutrient solution. The resulting
 mixture is the _working solution_.

4. Join the upper and lower halves of the grow box together and make sure they
are properly locked into place.

5. Insert a seedling plug to each holes on the upper half of the grow box. Make
sure the bottom of the cups is immersed in the solution by at least a centimeter.
If not, add **plain water** until the proper water level is reached.

6. Examine the boxes for leaks and do troubleshooting.

## Maintenance of the SNAP Hydroponics System

* Visit the setup every morning as early as possible to catch any insect larva
that may feed on the plants. The larva is active visible in the early morning.
After that they tend to hide and are harder to find.

* Expect slow plant growth in the first two weeks after the seedlings have been
transplanted. This is specially true if the seedlings has not been hardened off.
In this first couple of weeks the plant is adjusting to water logged conditions.

* After the first couple of weeks the plants will show vigorous growth. Most
leafy crops will be of marketable size during in third week onward.

* Expect the working solution level to go down as the plants grow. The level
will go down faster as the plants grow.

* Replenish the working solution when the working solution level becomes too low.
**Never** allow it to totally dry up. When replenishing the solution, **never**
allow the level of the solution to reach the bottom of the cup and submerge all
of the roots. The upper half of the plants’ roots must always be exposed to air
and thus not be submerged in water. Always observe this practice when
replenishing the contents of the grow box.

  <Figure caption="How the plant grows its roots and leaves as the nutrient
  solution level goes down.">

  </Figure>

* Crops that needs replenishment but are close to harvest are replenished with
**plain water**.

* Crops that needs to be grown for over a month are replenished with fresh
working solution.
