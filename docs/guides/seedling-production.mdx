Learn about the properties of good seed, proper storage of seeds and how to
raise healthy seedlings from seeds.

One of the most important factors that determines good harvest under favorable
conditions are the seeds and the seedlings raised from them.

## Good Seeds

Good harvests starts with good seeds. Good seeds come from reliable sources.
Properties of good seeds are listed below.

### High Viability

Good seeds germinate well. Seeds from reliable sources often list this metric as
the germination rate percentage. The higher the percentage, the more of the seeds
will germinate. For example, in a packet containing 1,000 seeds that lists the
germination rate as 90%, we can expect to germinate 900 seeds from the packet.

Aside from the percentage indicated in the seed packet, germination rates can
also be determined by germination test and flotation test.

Germination test can be performed by attempting to germinate a counted sample
from a lot of seed and determining the percentage of seeds that actually
germinated.

Most viable seeds sink in water. Flotation serves as a method to separate
viable seeds from seeds of poor quality.

### Produces Normal Seedling

Seedlings that sprout from good seeds have healthy radicle, strong stem, healthy
cotyledons and vigorous growth.

### Good Physical Purity

A good lot of seeds are free from debris like sand, stone, chaff, husks, soil,
etc. They are also free of seeds of other varieties or species; immature, broken,
undersized, shriveled, diseased and infested seeds.

### High Genetic Purity

Good seeds are produced from plants that are bred to preserve the desirable
traits and suppress the undesirable traits for a particular crop. Good seeds
with high genetic purity consistently displays these traits.

### Appropriate Moisture Content for Storage

Good seeds are not too moist that it supports the growth of pathogens and not
too dry that seeds lose viability during storage.

### Free of Diseases and Pests

Seeds that are free of diseases and pests is the start of a good harvest.

## Seedling Production

### Materials

* Sterilized growing media - sterilized cocopeat works well

* Sowing tray - a shallow plastic tub with drain holes at the bottom works well

  />

### Procedure

1. Fill the sowing tray with a layer of moist growing medium 2-3cm thick. Pack
and level the growing medium.

2. Scatter the small seeds uniformly and thinly. The amount depends on the need.
Consider provisioning for extra seedlings by about 15% of the number needed to
account for the seed germination rate and other factors that can result in
seedling loss.

3. After sowing, water liberally as needed. Expect germination in three to
five days.

4. Water the seedlings as needed until they are ready for prickling.

### Additional Tips

Seed packets usually indicate the batch date or the sow-by-date of the seeds in
the packet. When buying seed packets select the ones with a recent batch date or
with a sow-by-date that is months into the future. The freshness of the seeds
have significant impact on their viability and these dates are a reliable measure
of how fresh the seeds are.

To maintain high germination rate of seeds in an open packet, keep them in their
original foil packets with the open end folded shut. Keep them in a sealed
container and keep them refrigerated.
