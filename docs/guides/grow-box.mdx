Grow boxes or growing boxes are an essential part of the SNAP Hydroponics system.
The grow box acts as a reservoir for the SNAP working solution. The grow box
also holds the seedling plugs in place. This is an easy to follow step-by-step
guide on how to properly construct grow boxes from used styrofoam boxes (styrobox).

## Required Materials

### Styrobox

Boxes made of expanded polystyrene (EPS) known commonly as “styrofoam box” or
simply “styrobox” make excellent materials for a grow box. The size recommended
for use with SNAP Hydroponics is 20"×16"×6". These boxes can hold 10-12 liters
of nutrient solution and has enough room to grow up to eight leafy vegetables
and up to five fruiting vegetables. Styroboxes of this size are used to transport
US-imported grapes and are typically common during the months of September to
February. For details please [see the styrobox guide.](/docs/guides/styrobox)

### Lining Material

Styrofoam boxes has ventilation holes running along the edges. In order for the
bottom half of the box to hold the nutrient solution it must be lined with a
sturdy waterproofing sheet. In this guide we’ll use 20"✕30" polyethylene (PE)
plastic bags.

### Styrofoam Puncher

Styrofoam puncher is required to make holes on the upper half of the grow box
for the seedling plugs. A tin can of the appropriate diameter for the seedling
plug can be made into such a tool. For details please see this
[guide on making DIY styrofoam puncher.](/docs/guides/styrofoam-puncher/)

### Packaging Tape

This will be used to hold the lining material in place and optionally cover the
ventilation holes.

### Bamboo Stick

Bamboo stick or similar implement is used to draw guidelines on the styrofoam.
It is also used to safely remove the styrofoam piece from the styrofoam puncher
after each cut.

## Prepare the Styrobox

Although styrofoam grape boxes are of the same size, the way their upper and
lower halves are designed to fit together are different depending on the
manufacturer and the manufacturer’s type designation. This means the upper and
lower halves of the styrobox won’t fit properly if they are not of the same type.


:::tip

It’s possible to place the upper part of the grow box upside down in order to
not worry about the pair of upper and lower halves fitting. However, this comes
with disadvantages. For example, wind can easily blow them off.

:::

The styrobox has locking tabs to keep it shut. To open the box press on the lower
half at the middle of one of the shorter side to release the lock then pull the
upper half away.

It is recommended to wipe down the styrobox with a clean rag to remove dust,
grease and/or moisture, because these can cause tape, which we will be using to
hold the plastic liner in place, to fail.

## Work on the Upper Half of the Grow Box

Turn the upperhalf of the styrobox over and place it on a flat surface. It is
recommended to put a piece of plywood or cardboard in between the surface and
the styrofoam. This is to prevent the surface from being damaged by the styrofoam
puncher as it cuts through the styrofoam.

Draw guide lines connecting the ventilation holes from opposite sides of the box
as shown below. A hole should be made where the lines cross.

<Figure
  caption="Lines connecting ventilation holes in opposite sides. A hole is made
    where they intersect."
  alt="Upper half of the grow box showing how the guidelines are drawn."
  src="guide-lines.jpg"
/>

To make holes, put the sharp end of the styrofoam puncher on the styrofoam and
apply pressure to score the surface. Hold the tool by the handles and apply
pressure while turning the tool in a clockwise and counter-clockwise direction
making tool cut deeper through the foam. Continue this process until the tool
cuts through the foam.

Gently pull out the styrofoam puncher. A circular piece of foam will be left at
the cutting end of the tool. Use the stick to safely push one side of the piece
into the tool. This will cause the piece to rotate and the other side be pushed
out of the tool allowing it to be safely extracted.

Repeat this process to create the rest of the holes.

It is strongly recommended to use packing tape to cover the ventilation holes on
this half of the grow box if the growing area does not have protection from
mosquitoes. This will deny mosquitoes access to the working solution and stop
them from breeding in the grow box.

## Work on the Lower Half of the Grow Box

Start by preparing pieces of packing tape roughly three inches long. Position
the 20"✕30" plastic liner as shown below. Since the box is 20"✕16" in size, the
plastic liner should exceed the length of the box by five inches on both ends
and exceed the width of the box by four inches on both sides. These measurements
makes it easy to center the plastic liner on the lower half of the grow box.

<Figure
  caption="Proper positioning of the plastic liner over the lower half of the
  grow box."
  alt="Plastic liner laid over the lower half of the grow box."
  src="plastic-liner-over-lower-grow-box.jpg"
/>

Fold both ends of the plastic liner as shown below.

<Figure
  caption="Plastic liner with both ends properly folded."
  alt="Plastic liner over lower half of grow box with both ends folded."
  src="plastic-liner-with-ends-folded.jpg"
/>

Fold both sides of the plastic liner allowing the plastic liner to fit and “fall
through.”

<Figure
  caption="Plastic liner fitting through the lower half of the grow box."
  alt="Plastic liner with ends and sides folded fitting into the lower half of
  the grow box."
  src="plastic-liner-with-sides-folded.jpg"
/>

At this point the edge of the plastic liner should be flush along the length of
the grow box. Tape them in place at the center of the length of the grow box as
shown below.

<Figure
  caption="Sides of the plastic liner taped in place at the center."
  alt="Plastic liner taped at the center of the length of the grow box."
  src="plastic-liner-with-sides-taped.jpg"
/>

Add tape on the same sides of the grow box but towards the corner as shown below.
Note how the tape only holds the side flush edge of the plastic liner and not the
folded part of the adjacent side.

<Figure
  caption="Proper way of taping the corner."
  alt="Plastic liner taped at a corner."
  src="plastic-liner-with-corner-taped.jpg"
/>

Repeat for the rest of the corners.

<Figure
  caption="Plastic liner with all corners properly taped."
  alt="Plastic liner over lower half of grow box with all corners taped."
  src="plastic-liner-with-all-corners-taped.jpg"
/>

With the plastic liner fixed into position by tape, grab the folded ends of the
plastic liner and pull it towards the side of the grow box. The plastic liner
will make a triangular shaped fold at the corners.

<Figure
  caption="If done correctly, the corners will be folded neatly in place."
  alt="Folded ends of plastic liner positioned on the side of the grow box."
  src="plastic-liner-end-positioned.jpg"
/>

With a helping hand or with the use of clip to hold the plastic in place, tape
the ends of the plastic liner to the side of the grow box. Tape the corners first
then tape the center. Note that the plastic exceeds the height of the grow box’s
wall along its width and the plastic will go over the side of the styrobox as
you tape it in place. Repeat this process on the opposite side.

/>

The grow box is now complete.

## Remove the Locking Tabs (Optional)

The upper half of the styrobox has tabs that locks it in place on top of the
lower half. When the grow boxes are packed close together this locking mechanism
can make it difficult for you to open the grow box to examine what’s inside.
They can optionally be removed by cutting them off with a box cutter.
