The mixture of water and SNAP Hydroponics Nutrient Solution for Hydroponics A
(SNAP A) and SNAP Hydroponics Nutrient Solution for Hydroponics B (SNAP B) is
called the _working solution_. Below are the steps on how to to prepare it.

## Prepare Clean Water

Start with 10 liters of clean water. Water from regular sources like tap water,
well water, etc., works well. The use of pure rain water and pure distilled
(reverse osmosis) water is discouraged because pure rain water and pure distilled
water has a neutral pH. Preparing the working solution from water with a neutral
pH will result in a solution which has a pH that is too low to properly support
plant growth.

:::info

If using water from regular water sources, there is no need to monitor the pH.
SNAP nutrients has a high buffering capacity that helps maintain the proper
pH level of the working solution.

:::

## Add SNAP Nutrient Solution

Add 25mL of SNAP A and **mix well**. Add 25mL of SNAP B **mix well**. The order
by which SNAP A and SNAP B is added does not matter. However, it is important
to mix the solution well before adding the next SNAP solution.

:::caution

Do not mix SNAP A and SNAP B together before adding them to water. Mixing SNAP A
and SNAP B will cause them to react with each other which will render the
solution ineffective.
